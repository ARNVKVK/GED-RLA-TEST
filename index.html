    "1 At this point they came in sight of thirty or forty windmills that there are on that plain, and as soon as Don Quixote saw them he said to his squire, \"Fortune is arranging matters for us better than we could have shaped our desires ourselves, for look there, friend Sancha Panza, where thirty or more monstrous giants present themselves, all of whom I mean to engage in the battle and slay, and with whose spoils we shall begin to make our fortunes; for this is righteous warfare, and it is God's good service to sweep so evil a breed from off the face of the earth.\"",
    "2 \"What giants?\" said Sancho Panza.",
    "3 \"Those thou seest there,\" answered his master. \"with the long arms, and some have them nearly two leagues long\"",
    "4 \"Look, your worship,\" said Sancho: \"what we see there are not giants but windmills, and what seem to be their arms are the sails that turned by the wind make the millstone go.\"",
    "5 \"It is easy to see,\" replied Don Quixote, \"that thou art not used to this business of adventures: those are giants, and if thou art afraid, away with thee out of this and betake thyself to prayer while I engage them in fierce and unequal combat.\"",
    "6 So saying, he gave the spur to his steed Rocinante, heedless of the cries his squire Sancho sent after him, warning him that most certainly they were wines and not grants he was going to attack. He, however, was so positive they were giants that he neither heard the cries of Sancho, nor perceived, near as he was, what they were, but made at them shouting. \"Fly not, cowards and vile beings, for a single knight attacks you.\"",
    "7 A slight breeze at this moment sprang up, and the great sails began to move, seeing which Don Quixote exclaimed. \"Though ye flourish more arms than the giant Briareus, ye have to reckon with me.\"",
    "8 So saying, and commending himself with all his heart to his lady Dulcinea, imploring her to support him in such a peril, with lance us rest and covered by his buckler, he charged at Rocinante's fullest gallop and fell upon the first mill that stood in front of him, but as he drove his lance-point into the sail the wind whirled it round with such force that it shivered the lance to pieces, sweeping with it horse and rider, who went rolling over on the plain, in a sorry condition. Sancho hastened to his assistance as fast as his ass could go, and when he came up found him unable to move, with such a shock had Rocinante fallen with him.",
    "9 \"God bless me!\" said Sancho, \"did I not tell your worship to mind what you were about, for they were only windmills? and no one could have made any mistake about it but one who had something of the same kind in his head.\"",
    "10 \"Hush, friend Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote, \"the fortunes of war more than any other are liable to frequent fluctuations and moreover I think, and it is the truth, that that same sage Friston who carried off my study and books, has turned these giants into mill in order to rob me of the glory of vanquishing them, such is the enmity be bears me but in the end his wicked arts will avail but little against my good sword.\""

                content: [
    "1 In the small Ohio town where I grew up, many homes had parlors contained pianos, sideboards, and sofas, heavy objects signifying gentility. These pianos were rarely tuned. They went flat in summer around the fourth of July and sharp in winter at Christmas. Ours was a Story and Clark. On its music stand were copies of Stephen Foster and Ethelbert Nevin favorites, along with one Chopin prelude that my mother would practice for twenty minutes every three years. She had no patience, but since she thought Ohio-all of it, every scrapmade sense, she was happy and did not need to practice anything. Happiness is not infectious, but somehow her happiness infected my father, a pharmacist, and then spread through the rest of the household. My whole family was obstinately cheerful. I think of my two sisters, my brother, and my parents as having artificial pasted-on smiles, like circus clowns. They apparently thought cheer and good Christian words were universals, respected everywhere. The pianos were part of this cheer. They played for celebrations and moments of pleasant pain. Or rather: someone played them, but not too well, since excellent playing would have been faintly antisocial. \"Chopin,\" my mother said, shaking her head as she stumbled through the prelude. \"Why is he famous?\"",
    "2 When I was six, I received my first standing ovation. On the stage of the community auditorium, where the temperature was about 94° sweat fell from my forehead onto the piano keys, making their ivory surfaces slippery. At the conclusion of the piece, when everyone stood up to applaud, I thought they were just being nice. My playing had been mediocre; only my sweating had been extraordinary. Two years later, they stood up again. When I was eleven, they cheered. By that time I was astonishing these small-town audiences with Chopin and Rachmaninoff recital chestnuts. I thought I was a genius and read biographies of Einstein. Already the townspeople were saying that I was the best thing Parkersville had ever seen, that I would put the place on the map. Mothers would send their children by to watch me practice. The kids sat with their mouths open while I polished off another classic.",
    "3 Like many musicians, I cannot remember ever playing badly, in the sense of not knowing what I was doing. In high school, my identity was being sealed shut: my classmates called me \"El sañor long hair,\" even though I wore a crewcut, this being the 1950s. Whenever the town needed a demonstration of local genius, it called upon me. There were newspaper articles detailing my accomplishments, and I must have heard the phrase \"future concert career\" at least two hundred times. My parents smiled and smiled as I collected applause. My senior year, I gave a solo recital and was hired for umpteen weddings and funerals. I was good luck. On the fourth of July the townspeople brought out a piano to the city square so that I could improvise music between explosions at the fireworks display. Just before I left for college, I noticed that our neighbors wanted to come up to me ostensibly for small talk, but actually to touch me.",
    "4 In college I made a shocking discovery: other people existed in the world who were as talented as I was. If I sat down to play a Debussy etude, they would sit down and play Beethoven, only louder and faster than I had. I felt their breath on my neck. Apparently there were other small towns. In each one of these small towns there was a genius. Perhaps some geniuses were not actually geniuses. I practiced constantly and began to specialize in the non-Germanic piano repertoire. I kept my eye out for students younger than I was, who might have flashier technique. At my senior recital I played Mozart, Chopin, Ravel, and Debussy, with encore pieces by Scriabin and Thomson. I managed to get the audience to stand up for the last time.",
    "5 I was accepted into a large midwestern music school, famous for its high standards. Once there, I discovered that genius, to say nothing of talent, was a common commodity. Since I was only a middling composer, with no interesting musical ideas as such, I would have to make my career as a performer or teacher. But I didn't want to teach, and as a performer I lacked pizzazz. For the first time, it occurred to me that my life might be evolving into something unpleasant, something with the taste of stale bread.",
    "6 I was beginning to meet performers with more confidence than I had, young musicians to whom doubt was as alien as proper etiquette. Often these people dressed like tramps, smelled, smoked constantly, were gay or sadistic. Whatever their imbalances, they were not genteel. They did not represent small towns. I was struck by their eyes. Their eyes seemed to proclaim, \"The universe believes in me. It always has.\"",
    "7 My piano teacher was a man I will call Luther Stecker. Every year he taught at the music school for six months. For the following six months he toured. He turned me away from the repertoire with which I was familiar and demanded that I learn several pieces by composers whom I had not often played, including Bach, Brahms, and Liszt. Each one of these composers discovered a weak point in me: I had trouble keeping up the consistent frenzy required by Liszt, the mathematical precision required by Bach, the pianist fingerings of Brahms.",
    "8 I saw Stecker every week. While I played, he would doze off. When he woke, he would mumble some inaudible comment. He also coached a trio I participated in, and he spoke no more audibly then than he did during my private lesson."

    "1 Someone was stealing his honey. He had no idea how long it had been going on; he didn't keep close track of the stand. But one morning, as Burl turned into his driveway after making a delivery in the town, he noticed that the jars were lined up in a neat row like soldiers standing at attention. He pulled over, figuring one of the widows must have come by, bought a jar and done a little house keeping. He had started helping them with odd jobs after their husbands died, and now they seemed to see him as a fix-up project of their own. But when he went over and shook the cashbox, he found it empty. There were six jars that day (for some reason he counted), with three inches between each jar and their fronts perfectly aligned, the sample jar standing in front of them like their Captain.",
    "2 The next day he walked down the driveway with three more jars-honey from last year's flow, but people knew the season was about to start and would be stopping by. This time he found four jars set apart From one another in two neat pairs, with the sample jar off by itself.",
    "3 \"Looky here, an artist,\" he said to Lissa, who was sniffing after something in the grass. Two jars sold, he supposed, only when he shook the cash box, he found that it was, once again, empty. \"I take it back. Someone took them. who would do that?\"",
    "4 It wasn't a big deal, only six dollars and each year he gave away pounds of honey anyway. Probably the person had been out of cash and would bring the money by later. At the end of the day, though, he checked again-still nothing. Anyone who knew him would have left a note scrawled on the back of a napkin or old receipt-Hi B. IOU. No, this visitor had fiddled around with his jars, then taken two.",
    "5 That night, as he lay bored and hot in bed, he began, like Lissa with a good bone, to gnaw. It wasn't just a few missing jars that were the trouble; it was the state of things in general. You couldn't sell on an honor system anymore, not even out here. You had to wholesale to the supermarkets, but they'd only buy from Sue Bee, which mixed its honey in giant vats so the color would be the same bland shade in every jar. It was the economy, the pesticides, the land-use laws, yet the confusing thing was that it was nature, too, creatures so small you could barely see them, red specks the size of a pinhead, hairy shells with eight tenacious legs and jaws that could bring down the world.",
    "6 It was opening up a hive he'd thought might make it through the winter and finding it strewn like a war zone, dead bees everywhere, the green honey uncapped, bee carcasses drying out. Aristotle had placed bees higher than humans on scale, believing that in bees the laws of nature were expressed far more perfectly and firmly. Burl had pondered that after he read it. Did it mean that the bees' ways were simply starker, less muddied, an engine aimed entirely at the survival of the group? He wasn't sure, knew only that over the years he had found a deep pleasure, even a comfort, in his bees.",
    "7 He loved watching them in spring, seeing the field bees leave the hive and head into the fields, how they left empty and came back with their bellies full, their rear legs loaded up. He loved walking toward his bees on a July night and picking up the scent of nectar before he reached the hive. Inside, the bees were fanning water from the nectar; if he stood near enough, he could feel a draft play around his feet.",
    "8 He loved the way the pupae were curved like human fetuses, glossy white except for the purple splotches where the eyes would be. And the bees in winter, these especially loved, picturing how, as his own house stood drafty in the snow, the insects were gathered inside the hives in dense enter clusters, keeping each other warm.",
    "9 For years, now, they had made him honey and more honey, never stopping to notice when he took away a full honey super and replaced it with an empty one.",
    "10 There had always been some mites to deal with, but lately it had gotten so much worse, and he found himself lying awake at night picturing tracheal mites boring invisible holes through his windpipe and varroa mites sucking his blood."

                content: [
    "1 It takes a strong woman to make any sort of success of living in the West, and Hester undoubtedly was that. When people spoke about William Tavener as the most prosperous farmer in McPherson County, they usually added that his wife was a \"good manager.\" She was an executive woman, quick of tongue and something of an imperatrix. The only reason her husband did not consult her about his business was that she did not wait to be consulted.",
    "2 It would have been quite impossible for one man, within the limited sphere of human action, to follow all Heser's advice, but in the end William usually acted upon some of her suggestions. When she incessantly denounced the \"shiftlessness\" of letting a new threshing machine stand unprotected in the open, he eventually built a shed for it. When the first heavy rains came on, and the pigs rooted down the sod wall and made little paths all over it to facilitate their ascent, he heard his wife relate with relish the story of the little pig that built a mud house, to the minister at the dinner table, and William's gravity never relaxed for an instant. Silence, indeed, was William's refuge and his strength.",
    "3 William set his boys a wholesome example to respect their mother. People who knew him very well suspected that he even admired her. He was a hard man towards his neighbors, and even towards his sons, grasping, determined and ambitious.",
    "4 One spring night Hester sat in a rocking chair by the sitting room window, darning socks. She rocked violently and sent her long needle vigorously back and forth over her gourd, and it took only a very casual glance to see that she was wrought up over something. William sat on the other side of the table reading his farm paper. If he had noticed his wife's agitation, his calm, clean-shaven face betrayed no sign of concern. He must have noticed the sarcastic turn of her remarks at the supper table, and he must have noticed the moody silence of the older hoys as they ate. But William Tavener never heeded ominous forecasts in the domestic horizon, and he never looked for a storm until it broke.",
    "5 After supper the boys had gone to the pond under the willows in the big cattle corral, to get rid of the dust of plowing. Hester could hear an occasional splash and a laugh ringing clear through the stillness of the night, as she sat by the open window. She sat silent for almost an hour reviewing in her mind many plans of attack. But she was too vigorous a woman to be much of a strategist, and she usually came to her point with directness. At last she cut her thread and suddenly put her darning down, saying emphatically:",
    "6 \"William, I don't think it would hurt you to let the boys go to that circus in town tomorrow.\"",
    "7 William continued to read his farm paper, but it was not Hester's custom to wait for an answer. She usually divined his arguments and assalled them one by one before he uttered them.",
    "8 \"You've been short of hands all summer, and you've worked the boys hard, and a man ought use his own flesh and blood as well as he does his hired hands. We're plenty able to afford it, and it's little enough our boys ever spend. I don't see how you can expect 'em to be steady and hard workin', unless you encourage 'em a little. I never could see much harm in circuses, and our boys have never been to one. The animals are real instructive, an' our boys don't get to see much out here on the prairie. It was different where we were raised, but the boys have got no advantages here, an' if you don't take care, they'll grow up to be greenhorns.\"",
    "9 Hester paused a moment, and William folded up his paper, but vouchsafed no remark. His sisters in Virginia had often said that only a quiet man like William could ever have lived with Hester Perkins. Secretly, William was rather proud of his wife's \"gift of speech,\" and of the fact that she could talk in prayer meeting as fluently as a man. He confined his own efforts in that line to a brief prayer at Covenant meetings.",
    "10 Hester shook out another sock and went on.",
    "11 \"Nobody was ever hurt by going' to a circus. Why, law me! I remember I went to one myself once, when I was little, I had most forgot about it. It was over at Pewtown, an' I remember how I had set my heart on going. I don't think I'd ever forgiven my father if he hadn't taken me, though that red clay road was in a frightful way after the rain. I mind they had an elephant and six pol parrots, an' a Rocky Mountain lion, an' a cage of monkeys, an' two camels. My! but they were a sight to me then!\"",
    "12 Hester dropped the black sock and shook her head and smiled at the recollection. She was not expecting anything from William yet, and she was fairly startled when he said gravely, in much the same tone in which he announced the hymns in prayer meeting:",
    "13 \"No, there was only one camel, The other was a dromedary.\"",
    "14 She peered around the lamp and looked at him keenly.",
    "15 \"Why, William, how come you to know?\"",

    "**Email From: Evan Riley, Chair, Juniper Estates Neighborhood Committee**",
    "1. I represent the Juniper Estates Neighborhood Committee. Last night, community residents had a meeting in which they expressed views on the re-zoning request Brannick's Superstore proposed. Nearly 100% of the attendees were opposed to the Antrim Zoning Commission allowing a Brannick's to be built on the land adjacent to Juniper Estates. I have been asked to summarize neighborhood opposition.",
    "2. A Brannick's Superstore is a wonderful place to shop. It provides groceries, prescriptions, and even auto repairs. However, it is not an appealing structure to have in one's backyard. This is especially true for residents of Juniper Estates. Situated on the northern edge of the Antrim city limits, Juniper Estates is more rural than urban. Many of our residents moved to the northern edge of Antrim to be near the woods and the wildlife. They wanted to be away from the city, not in the middle of a busy shopping mecca. Furthermore, construction of this superstore would remove a large portion of forest from the area adjoining Juniper Estates and uproot the wildlife that depends on it.",
    "3. In place of deer, this superstore would bring in cars and chaos. With traffic congestion comes increased pollution and noise. In effect, a store the size of Brannick's would bring the city right to our doorsteps. While we live within the city limits of Antrim, we reside in the rural community of Juniper Estates, and we want to keep it rustic.",
    "4. Even though most Juniper Estates residents commute to jobs downtown, about 15% of our residents work right here in the surrounding area. These folks are largely small-business owners and their employees. They depend on the purchases made by residents of the Antrim community for their livelihoods. These shopkeepers are happy to let members of the rest of the community spend their city earnings in our shops. Antrim shoppers know that our shops are unique and distinctive, offering original, often handmade products. These businesses are a source of both income and pride for their owners and employees.",
    "5. Unfortunately, the shops near Juniper Estates could not compete with the prices of a nearby superstore. If Brannick's is right next door, most people will shop there. Brannick's can afford to sell for less. Its presence in the community could force many of our local businesses to close. Even people who are loyal customers of the small, specialized shops could eventually succumb to the lure of a superstore.",
    "6. Additionally, the Property Trends website states that building a superstore typically drops home values by 10% This is reason enough for members of our community to protest the proposed zoning adjustment.",
    "7. Antrim already has two Brannick's Superstores. How many superstores do we need? If you change the zoning legislation, let it be for something that will enhance the beauty and uniqueness of our community. Juniper Estates has enough traffic and noise. We need to protect the businesses we have and the independent personality of our rural community. We strongly urge you to decline Brannick's re-zoning request.",
    "**Press Release: Brannick's Superstore Is Coming!**",
    "8. Thanks for being our new neighbor!",
    "9. Brannick's application for the re-zoning of land adjacent to Juniper Estates has been approved with some revisions. We are now preparing to begin construction. Although our original plan was to build a full-sized store on this land, we have modified our plan to accommodate the community concerns that were presented to us by the Antrim Zoning Commission. People in the neighborhood were unhappy with our plan, and beginning a feud with potential customers is never an option for Brannick's. Therefore, we have made some concessions that we hope will please our customers in the area.",
    "10. The first concern of our new neighbors is the noise and traffic the store could generate. Unfortunately, traffic and noise comes with the territory of a superstore. Brannick's Superstores are popular, and this one will no doubt draw customers from nearby towns. However, we have worked with the Antrim City Council to find a way to minimize the noise and traffic and to limit our impact on Juniper Estates.",
    "11. We have agreed to forgo our original plan to use the full 200,000 square feet possible under the original re-zoning request. Our store will instead occupy only 125,000 square feet. This size will allow for a buffer zone of wooded area between our store and Juniper Estates. Brannick's will maintain this wooded area; our landscaping team will scrupulously clean up any trash that winds blow into this area. This area will ensure that the store is not visible to nearby residents and will greatly reduce the traffic noise.",
    "12. Furthermore, in the spirit of community involvement, we will place an 80-inch plasma screen within the store for local ads and announcements. And this service will be free to all local businesses! These ads could generate more business for local shops, because Brannick's general merchandise and services aren't competition for these more specialized shops.",
    "13. We will soon have nearly 100 job openings. Applications for the new store are available online. We are looking forward to being your new neighbor."

                content: [
    "1 \"Water is currently the leading renewable energy source used by electric utilities to generate electric power.\" - Energy Information Administration (EIA)",
    "2 A predominant source of hydroelectric power is moving water-the water that runs in rivers, streams, and other waterways. The moving water turns turbines, which can resemble large propeller or fan blade. As a turbine spins, an axle at its center also spins. Machines then use this constant spinning motion to convert the energy of the moving water into electricity. On a larger scale, the world's oceans are also moving-in currents throughout these vast bodies of water, and as waves along hundreds of thousands of miles of coastline. As with land-based waterways, the power of ocean waves could be used to produce electricity. Currently, the technology exists to meet a significant portion of the world's energy demands by converting wave power to electricity.",
    "3 There are several types of devices used to capture ocean wave power, such as point absorbers, terminators (also called oscillating water columns), and attenuators (see Table 1). Additionally, there are several methods and locations of deployment for these devices, including fixed and floating, and onshore, near shore, and offshore. Together, the wave-capturing device, the deployment method, and the deployment location determine the amount of energy captured and available for conversion into electricity. See Table 1 for examples of wave-capturing devices, deployment methods, and deployment locations.",
    "4 As with any technology that converts our world's resources to energy, there are advantages and disadvantages to using ocean wave power. Supporters of the technology point to a critical advantage-ocean wave power does not release heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere. Additionally, if ocean wave power provides a portion of the electricity currently being met by fossil fuel power, then fewer fossil fuels will be burned and, in turn, fewer heat-trapping gases will be released. Thus, ocean wave power can lead to a reduction in heat-trapping gases accumulating in the atmosphere. Proponents of using ocean waves to generate power cite another advantage: the technology does not use or waste water, but merely displaces it.",
    "5 These arguments are countered by opponents of ocean wave power, who contend that disadvantages of using waves to generate electricity are more numerous than the advantages. They argue that the technology is likely to disrupt marine ecosystems and introduce pollutants into marine waters. Specifically, energy collection and conversion devices may disrupt migratory patterns, expose marine animals to risk of entanglement in the equipment, and repel or attract species to such a degree that ecosystems are thrown out of balance. Adversaries of the technology do not limit their argument to the environmental impact of ocean wave technology. Instead, they claim that deploying ocean wave devices could also disrupt the relationships that people have with the oceans by ruining their views of the seaside.",
    "6 Whether one is a proponent or opponent of harnessing the ocean's wave power for our own use, it is clear that there are benefits and pitfalls to technology. Advocates of ocean wave power argue that cleaner energy production is worth the risk of disrupting marine habitats. But people who challenge the use of ocean wave power counter that any risk to our fragile ecosystems is too much of a risk."

    "1 There are hard sells, and then there are really hard sells. Anyone who has ever tried to build a landfill is probably keenly aware of this. People know that landfills are a disgusting, If necessary, evil and that they spread disease and pestilence throughout populated community. People want them located as far from their home and business as possible. They do not want trash blowing onto their properties, nor do they want to be downwind of putrid air that ruins their time outdoors.",
    "2 For those in the trash disposal business, trying to open a new landfill site and fighting the legal battles that this often brings are par for the course. However, a trash disposal company south of Austin, Texas, has created a successful model for keeping everyone happy-from rural neighbors to local environmentalists. How did the owners of the company manage this? They chose to take themselves out of the fight. They are so committed to running a model business and being a good neighbor that, over time, opposition to their landfill has gone away completely.",
    "3 Texas Disposal Systems (TDS) is a profitable business that operates a landfill, recycling/resale center, composting operation, conference center, and exotic animal farm in Creedmoor, Texas. Brothers and co-owners Bob and Jim Gregory set high expectations for themselves, and this has been key to their success. Although all solid waste management companies in a state are supposed to adhere to the same regulations, some companies try to get by with the least possible effort. Some companies put on a thin veneer of being good neighbors while they really focus on their own self-interests.",
    "4 The Gregory brothers are different in this regard. For instance, they put their own facilities, notably a pavilion that hosts fund-raisers and dinners, downwind from the landfill's working face. Bob Gregory explains that showing people the reality of the anything that they would not put up with themselves. They have prioritized controlling odors and picking up stray trash so successfully that the more than 10,000 people who visit the site annually are more aware of the pleasant views and clean, fresh air than the landfill nearby.",
    "5 Two of the biggest challenges for waste disposal operations are odors and the trash itself. About 2,000 tons of trash is handled daily at the Creedmoor facility. The facility keeps the working part of the landfill as small as it can and also uses biofilters, recycle sprays, and other treatments to mitigate odors. The owners also built high fences to help prevent trash from blowing away. Furthermore, they have a street crew operating six days a week to patrol the area and catch any stray trash that makes it beyond the fences.",
    "6 Searching for the right fences actually inspired the Gregory brothers to include exotic animals on the land. They did not want to use industrial chain-link fences around the property because they thought that would send the wrong message to the neighbors. The land would look forbidding rather than welcoming. The brothers wanted to find functional, but inviting, fences. As they shopped around, they saw a number of high fences on exotic animal farms and thought that maybe their neighbors would like the idea of animals on the land surrounding the landfill. The neighbors did, indeed, like the animals. Currently, hundreds of acres owned by TDS are home to more than two thousand native and exotic animals of eighty species.",
    "7 TDS also reaches out to the community by allowing various charity groups to host fund-raisers on the pavilion. About 150 groups hold events each year, raising thousands of dollars per event. There are also two beautifully appointed cabins on the property designated for community use. In addition, TDS hosts its own outreach events, like hosting volunteers from Big Brothers Big Sisters on the ranch.",
    "8 Moreover, TDS runs a drop-off center for items like grills, tools, or bicycles in working condition and sells them at a garage sale. TDS also has retails outlet for compost products and sells topsoil, mulch, and compost produced on-site.",
    "9 The Gregory brothers provide example of how to run a profitable business that is sensitive to the needs of the community and is a great neighbor. One bonus of handling their operation so wall is that TDS can reinvest money into making improvements."

                content: [
    "**Language Acquisition in Young Children by Jack Kylerson**",
    "1 As an English-speaking adult, taking five years of Mandarin classes does not necessarily result in becoming a fluent speaker of this Chinese language. Yet children across the globe learn their native language fluently by the age of five without opening a grammar book or dictionary. What allows children to learn language so easily? Why do children seem to learn a language, or even multiple languages, without any effort? Researchers have identified both \"nature\" and \"nurture\" answers to these questions.",
    "2 The \"nature\" answer refers to the natural biology or \"hard wiring\" in a child's brain that allows him or her to learn, retain, and master language quickly and easily. Researchers believe that children are born with a natural cognitive instinct to learn language. Thus, whatever language children are exposed to during their early years, whether it be Korean, Swedish, or Portuguese, their brains will automatically and instinctively retain the grammar and vocabulary. This natural cognitive capacity allows children to absorb language from their natural environment without formal classroom study. Other studies suggest that the brains of infants and children may also contain a framework of \"universal grammar.\" This allows children's brains to create grammar rules without formal instruction. For example, after hearing word pairs such as chair/chairs, apple/apples, and boy/boys, the child's brain unconsciously learns that an \"s\" ending indicates a plural. The child will then speak the word pair shoe/shoes without ever having heard that pair and without directly being taught that an \"s\" ending means plural.",
    "3 The \"nurture\" answer to the question of how children learn language deals with the experiences and exposure that a child has to language. Rather than focusing on the qualities of the brain with which a baby is born, this type of research examines how adults interact with infants and children to help them acquire language. For example, researchers have noted that adults often speak differently to children than they do to other adults, using simpler words, repetitive phrases, and often higher-pitched voices. These differences are noted across languages and cultures, and researchers think this may help children learn language more readily.",
    "**Dual Language Programs Show Promise for Young Children by Frances Hamilton**",
    "In a first-grade class in West Jordan, Utah, visitors are apt to hear children say \"por favor\" and \"gracias\" when they need help. These kids are native English speakers, but schools across the state are reaping the rewards of a successful dual language program. Students spend half of their day with English-speaking teachers and study reading and writing. They spend the other half of the day with Spanish-speaking teachers, studying science, mathematics, and social studies.",
    "The initial test scores for these dual language-learning students suggest that students maintain their native language skills and even excel past their single-language learning peers in some academic areas. Johanna Watzinger-Tharp, a linguistics professor at the University of Utah, says that she is not surprised to see these programs working so well. Teaching children in a foreign, or second, language at a young age, she says, helps the brain to develop and expand, which leads to greater success in many other academic areas.",
    "Despite the promising results, there are critics of the program. Many parents worry that too many students who speak the same language are in the classrooms together. They fear that despite the dual language efforts, a classroom dominated by one language or the other will disrupt the language acquisition process. Other critics argue that the enrollment should be larger. Many parents are disappointed that their children are not selected to participate.",
    "A problem of people wishing for greater enrollment size, however, is a good one to have if it means a program is successful and necessary. And while it is too early to predict whether these youngsters will use their second language skills in their adult careers, many parents are hopeful. In a global economy, language and cultural skills will be valuable. Some parents are enrolling their children in the dual immersion program specifically in hopes of better job prospects in the future."

    "TO: All Staff",
    "FROM: Patricia Hornby, Human Resources Department",
    "RE: Change in Mailing Protocol - Please Read!",
    "1. After much consideration and discussion, UniPro has decided to change its long-standing protocol for handling outgoing mail.",
    "2. Effective September 1, our mailroom will no longer accept outgoing mail without a mail authorization slip. You will be required to fill out and clip a mailing slip (paper clips only, NO TAPE OR STAPLES) to each piece of outgoing mail before you submit it to the mailroom or leave it at one of the courier collection points. Multiple items being mailed at the same time by the same employee may be rubber-banded together with a single form covering all items in the batch. Outgoing mail without a mailing slip will either be returned to sender or, if no return address is marked, destroyed.",
    "3. A sample of the mailing slip will be available next week. As you will see, the form requires each person using our mail service to enter his or her name and Employee ID Number in the blanks provided.",
    "4. While we realize this new mailing protocol will add extra steps and possibly frustration to your day, the administration has deemed it a cost-saving measure. At present, we have no way to determine which departments at UniPro are making the fullest use of our mailroom, including charging extra services (same-day or next-day delivery, international delivery, etc.) to the company. Our mailing costs have spiraled upward in recent years. With the new system, we will have a better sense of our postal needs and be able to budget accordingly.",
    "5. There have also been reports of employees routing their personal mail through our mailroom. Please accept this as a friendly reminder that ONLY UNIPRO MAIL IS TO BE PROCESSED IN OR THROUGH OUR COMPANY MAILROOM. Due to tight budgets we are unable to process your personal mail for you, even if you have provided your own postage. Please send your personal mail through postal depots off-site.",
    "6. In order to ease the transition, the mailroom staff have indicated that they will be happy to print and photocopy the new mail slips with your name and Employee ID Number preprinted on the blanks. You may also pick up paper clips from the mailroom, which is open from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. You are also welcome to write your name and Employee ID Number on the attached sample and photocopy the slip yourself.",
    "7. Eventually we hope to streamline the process by adding a scan code to the mailing slip so that postage costs will automatically be calculated as the mailroom processes the mail. In the meantime, we thank you for your patience and for understanding that our goal is to make UniPro more competitive in the market."

    "1. All I know about music is that not many people ever really hear it. And even then, on the rare occasions when something opens within, and the music enters, what we mainly hear, or hear corroborated, are personal, private, vanishing evocations. But the man who creates the music is hearing something else, is dealing with the roar rising from the void and imposing order on it as it hits the air. What is evoked in him, then, is of another order, more terrible because it has no words, and triumphant, too, for that same reason. And his triumph, when he triumphs, is ours. I just watched Sonny's face. His face was troubled, he was working hard, but he wasn't with it. And I had the feeling that, in a way, everyone on the bandstand was waiting for him, both waiting for him and pushing him along. But as I began to watch Creole, I realized that it was Creole who held them all back. He had them on a short rein. Up there, keeping the beat with his whole body, wailing on the fiddle, with his eyes half closed, he was listening to everything, but he was listening to Sonny. He was having a dialogue with Sonny. He wanted Sonny to leave the shoreline and strike out for the deep water. He was Sonny's witness that deep water and drowning were not the same thing-he had been there, and he knew. And he wanted Sonny to know. He was waiting for Sonny to do the things on the keys which would let Creole know that Sonny was in the water.",
    "2. And, while Creole listened, Sonny moved, deep within, exactly like someone in torment. I had never before thought of how awful the relationship must be between the musician and his instrument. He has to fill it, this instrument, with the breath of life, his own. He has to make it do what he wants it to do. And a piano is just a piano. It's made out of so much wood and wires and little hammers and big ones, and ivory. While there's only so much you can do with it, the only way to find this out is to try; to try and make it do everything.",
    "3. And Sonny hadn't been near a piano in over a year. And he wasn't on much better terms with his life, not the life that stretched before him now. He and the piano stammered, started one way, got scared, stopped; started another way, panicked, marked time, started again; then seemed to have found a direction, panicked again, got stuck. And the face I saw on Sonny I'd never seen before. Everything had been burned out of it, and, at the same time, things usually hidden were being burned in, by the fire and fury of the battle which was occurring in him up there.",
    "4. Yet, watching Creole's face as they neared the end of the first set, I had the feeling that something had happened, something I hadn't heard. Then they finished, there was scattered applause, and then, without an instant's warning, Creole started into something else, it was almost sardonic, it was Am I Blue. And, as though he commanded, Sonny began to play. Something began to happen. And Creole let out the reins. The dry, low, black man said something awful on the drums, Creole answered, and the drums talked back. Then the horn insisted, sweet and high, slightly detached perhaps, and Creole listened, commenting now and then, dry, and driving, beautiful and calm and old. Then they all came together again, and Sonny was part of the family again. I could tell this from his face. He seemed to have found, right there beneath his fingers, a damn brand-new piano. It seemed that he couldn't get over it. Then, for a while, just being happy with Sonny, they seemed to be agreeing with him that brand-new pianos certainly were a gas.",
    "5. Then Creole stepped forward to remind them that what they were playing was the blues. He hit something in all of them, he hit something in me, myself, and the music tightened and deepened, apprehension began to beat the air. Creole began to tell us what the blues were all about. They were not about anything very new. He and his boys up there were keeping it new, at the risk of ruin, destruction, madness, and death, in order to find new ways to make us listen. For, while the tale of how we suffer, andhow we are delighted, and how we may triumph is never new, it always must be heard. There isn't any other tale to tell, it's the only light we've got in all this darkness."

    "Subject: Exploitation of unpaid interns",
    "From: Interns for Intern Benefits, advocating for all current and former interns, or indentured servants, as we were called in the seventeenth century",
    "Dear Corporations:",
    "1 We are a group of interns and former interns who are spending our college summers, and sometimes the months following our graduations, working without pay in your companies. We are performing tasks and being given work responsibilities like any other employees, spending full days working alongside your paid employees, and using our knowledge and skills for the benefit of your companies. However, for all our long hours toiling away in your offices, warehouses, and studios, we are not receiving one dime in pay.",
    "2 Statistics show that half of all college graduates held internships in 2008. Of these hundreds of thousands of students, experts estimate that 25% to 50% were unpaid. That is a frightening amount of unpaid labor!",
    "3 We are writing to ask you to cease this practice of exploiting unpaid interns in your businesses.",
    "4 The United States Department of Labor issued Fact Sheet 71: Internship Programs Under the Fair Labor Standards Act to use as a guideline for whether interns like us must be paid minimum wage and overtime under the Fair Labor Standards Act for services we provide your companies. Fact Sheet #71 provides strict criteria that must be followed by employers, including these criteria: The internship must be similar to training that would be given in an educational environment.",
    "5. While many of us have performed work for your companies that did not meet all the legal criteria, we have worked long hours performing tasks and providing services that were profitable for your businesses. Clearly, we should have been paid wages and overtime as required when our service did not meet the internship criteria under the Fair Labor Standards Act.",
    "6. We admit there is stiff competition for jobs in our fields, and the experience gained during our internships will bolster our résumés. Yes, we are gaining valuable work experience from our internships, as intended by the Fair Labor Standards Act, and some of us are even receiving college credit in exchange for our work. And, yes, we realize that we stand a better chance of landing permanent jobs if we've been interns. In fact, in 2008, employers extended job offers to nearly 70% of their interns, and 83.6% accepted the offers.",
    "7. Even so, we allege that employers are exploiting us for their own greedy benefit because interns can do the work of paid regular employees for free. Not only are you denying us the right to earn a fair day's wage for a fair day's work, but you are also denying us the right to unemployment insurance, workers' compensation insurance, and Social Security contributions.",
    "8. We understand our country's long history of indentured servitude. In the 17th and 18th centuries, labor for businesses and farms was scarce, and poor people from other countries indentured themselves to American enterprises (or their parents indentured them if they were underage) for the mutual benefit of both parties. Like interns today, these early indentured servants provided their services and labor; however, in return they were given food and clothing and had their transportation costs to the United States paid by those who needed their labor. Sometimes, if they were lucky, they even received some small payment at the end of their years-long indenture.",
    "9. But most of these early \"interns\" were no happier with their servitude than we modern interns are. The prevalence of servitude sometimes voluntary, sometimes not gave highly charged meanings to words like \"liberty\" \"freedom,\" and \"tyranny.\" In fact, at the age of 12, our renowned statesman Benjamin Franklin was indentured to his much older brother for a nine-year term, and Franklin was supposed to receive wages during only the last year!"

    "Gertrude Stein (1874-1946) was an American writer and poet who spent much of her life in France. She befriended and mentored many expatriate American writers and artists, including F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, and Sherwood Anderson. In 1922, Anderson wrote the following introduction to one of Stein's books.",
    "**The Work of Gertrude Stein by Sherwood Anderson**",
    "1. One evening some years ago, my brother came to my rooms in the city of Chicago bringing with him a book by Gertrude Stein. The book was called Tender Buttons, and there was a good deal of fuss and fun being made over it in American newspapers. I had already read a book of Miss Stein's called Three Lives and had thought it contained some of the best writing ever done by an American. I was curious about this new book.",
    "2. My brother had been at a gathering of literary people on the evening before, and someone had read aloud from Miss Stein's new book. After a few lines the reader stopped and was greeted by loud shouts of laughter. It was generally agreed that the author had done a thing we Americans call \"putting something across\"-meaning that she had, by a strange freakish performance, managed to attract attention to herself, get herself discussed in the newspapers, become for a time a figure in our hurried, harried lives.",
    "3. My brother had not been satisfied with the explanation of Miss Stein's work then current in America, and so he bought Tender Buttons, and we sat for a time reading the strange sentences. \"It gives words an oddly new intimate flavor and at the same time makes familiar words seem almost like strangers,\" he said. What my brother did was to set my mind going on the book.",
    "4. And now, after these years, and having sat with Miss Stein by her own fire in the rue de Fleurus in Paris, I am asked to write something by way of an introduction to a new book she is about to issue.",
    "5. As there is in America an impression of Miss Stein's personality, not at all true and rather foolishly romantic, I would like first of all to brush that aside. I had myself heard stories of a long dark room with a languid woman lying on a couch, smoking cigarettes, sipping absinthes perhaps and looking out upon the world with tired, disdainful eyes. Now and then she rolled her head slowly to one side and uttered a few words, taken down by a secretary who approached the couch with trembling eagerness to catch the falling pearls.",
    "6. You will perhaps understand something of my own surprise and delight when I was taken to her to find instead of this languid impossibility, a woman of striking vigor, a subtle and powerful mind, a discrimination in the arts such as I have found in no other American born man or woman, and a charmingly brilliant conversationalist",
    "7. Since Miss Stein's work was first brought to my attention I have been thinking of it as the most important pioneer work done in the field of letters in my time. My thought in the matter is that every artist working with words as his medium must at times be profoundly irritated by what seem the limitations of his medium.",
    "8. One works with words and one would like words that have a taste on the lips, that have a perfume to the nostrils, rattling words one can throw into a box and shake, making a sharp, jingling sound, words."

    "Few animals have been as central to the Pacific human experience as salmon. Their annual migrations are a miracle of nature. They feed us and their presence tells us that our rivers are still healthy. From grizzly bears to orca whales, at least 137 different species depend on the marine-rich nutrients that wild salmon provide.",
    "The last intact salmon watersheds around the North Pacific are composed of free-flowing rivers and dense forests, which provide clean drinking water and absorb carbon to slow climate change. Pacific salmon fuel a $3 billion industry, supporting tens of thousands of jobs and local economies and communities around the Pacific Rim. Millions of people around the Pacific rely on salmon as a healthy and reliable source of protein. Native people have always seen the salmon as the life-sustaining centerpiece of their culture, dating back millennia.",
    "In short, salmon are the key to protecting a way of life rooted in the North Pacific environment: protect salmon and you protect forests, food, water, communities, and economies. But our work over the last two decades has shown that only an aggressive, proactive approach on the strongest remaining salmon rivers - salmon strongholds - can halt the decline of these iconic species and all the benefits we derive from them.",
    "Salmon and freshwater ecosystems are inextricably linked by feedbacks between salmon runs, food webs, and riparian forests. Salmon runs function as enormous pumps that push vast amounts of marine nutrients from the ocean to the headwaters of otherwise low productivity rivers. For example, sockeye salmon runs in southwest Alaska contribute up to 170 tons of phosphorous per year to Lake Iliamna.",
    "These nutrients are incorporated into food webs in rivers and surrounding landscapes by a host of over 50 species of mammals, birds, and fish that forage on salmon eggs, juveniles, and adults in freshwater. Predators, such as brown bears, disperse these marine nutrients into surrounding forests, enhancing the growth of stream-side trees that shade and protect stream banks from excessive erosion. In southeastern Alaska, spawning salmon contribute up to 25% of the nitrogen in the foliage of trees, resulting in tree growth rates nearly three-times higher than in areas without salmon spawning. As they grow and age, these trees eventually return the favor for salmon by falling into salmon streams and forming log jams that provide shelter for juvenile salmon and protect the gravels that adults use for spawning",
    "Abundant salmon returns feed the rivers and shape the habitats that support the next generation of wild fish. Generally, the more pristine, diverse, and productive the watershed, the healthier the salmon stocks.",
    "Salmon are the center of economies and cultures Coastal human communities depend on salmon for both protein and income. The world's largest sockeye salmon run in Alaska's Bristol Bay brings in $500 million each year for commercial, recreational, and subsistence fishermen. In southeast Alaska, nearly 48 million wild salmon are harvested each year, with a combined economic value of nearly $1 billion annually. In Kamchatka, Russia, 80% of the economy is dependent on salmon and other seafood."

The ushers stood on chairs by the doors and reached into the big wooden crates. There was straw all over the floor of the lobby and balls of newspaper from strange cities. I knew she was the girl for me. I'd walk her home. She'd hug the dish to her chest. The street lights would be on and the moon behind the trees. She'd talk about collecting enough pieces for our family of eight.",

It was dark there, but outside it was bright and cold. They didn't finish the show. Business would pick up then, and the Wells Theatre wouldn't need a Dish Night to bring the people in. The one we had gone to the week before was the last one ever and we hadn't known.",

This would be the movie of my life, this walking home under the moon from a movie with a girl holding a dinner plate under her arm like a book.",
    "I believed this is what I was fighting for. Everywhere in Europe I saw broken pieces of crockery. In the farmhouses, the cafes. Along the roads were drifts of smashed china. On a beach, in the sand where I was crawling, I found a bit of it the sea washed in, all smooth with blue veins of a pattern.",

                content: [
    "Genetically Modifed Organisms (GMOs) have become a signifcant part of moderm agriculture and food production. These organisms have undergone genetic engineering to introduce new traits, enhance existing characteristics, or improve resistance to various environmental factors. While GMOs promise numerous advantages, they also come with potential risks that necessitate careful consideration and transparent labeling for consumers.",
    "**What Are GMOS?**",
    "GMOs are organisms whose genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering techniques. This modification involves the manipulation of DNA to achieve desired traits that are not naturally found in the organism. Common GMO crops include corn, soybeans, cotton, and canola. These crops have been modified for various reasons, such as increased yield, pest resistance, and improved nutritional content.",
    "**Advantages of GMOs**",
    "The development and adoption of GMOs offer several advantages, particularly in agriculture. Here are some key benefits.",
    "**Resistance to Pests and Insects:** One of the primary benefits of GMOs is their resistance to pests and insects. By incorporating genes from naturally pest-resistant plants or bacteria, GMO crops can produce their own insecticides. For instance, Bt corn contains a gene from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis that produces a protein toxic to certain pests. This reduces the need for chemical pesticides, lowering production costs and minimizing environmental impact.",
    "**Tolerance to Extreme Weather and Soil Conditions:** GMOs can be engineered to withstand harsh weather conditions such as drought, extreme heat, or cold. Drought-resistant crops, for example, can maintain productivity in low-water conditions, which is increasingly important in the face of climate change. Similarly, salt-tolerant crops can thrive in soils with high salinity, making agriculture possible in previously unsuitable areas.",
    "**The Need for Transparent Labeling**",
    "Given the indistinguishable nature of genetic modifications at the visual or taste level, it is crucial to have clear labeling for GMO products. Consumers have the right to know what is in their food and make informed choices. Transparent labeling allows individuals to avoid GMOs if they have allergies or ethical concerns about genetic modification. It also promotes trust and accountability within the food industry.",
    "**Considering the Consumption of GMOs**",
    "When it comes to consuming GMOs, it is essential to weigh the benefits against the potential risks. While GMOs can offer solutions to agricultural challenges and food security, the long-term health effects are still not fully understood. Most of the negative outcomes associated with GMO consumption are speculative, yet they underscore the importance of rigorous testing and monitoring.",
    "**Health Considerations**",
    "Allergies: As mentioned, GMOs can introduce new allergens. Individuals with known allergies should be cautious and check for labels indicating GMO content.",
    "Antibiotic Resistance: Some GMOs are developed using antibiotic resistance markers, raising concerns about contributing to antibiotic resistance.",
    "**Ethical and Environmental Considerations**",
    "Biodiversity: The widespread cultivation of GMO crops can lead to reduced genetic diversity in agriculture, making crops more vulnerable to diseases and pests.",
    "Ecological Balance: The potential for gene transfer and the creation of superweeds highlight the need for responsible GMO management to protect ecosystems.",
    "**Conclusion**",
    "GMOs represent a complex intersection of science, agriculture, and public health. While they offer substantial benefits in terms of crop resilience, nutritional enhancement, and yield improvement, the potential risks cannot be ignored. Transparent labeling and informed consumption are vital to ensuring that GMOs contribute positively to global food systems without compromising health or environmental integrity. As research continues, it is crucial to balance innovation with caution, safeguarding both human and the planet's ecosystems."

                content: [
    "**Biobigotry by Kristal Gardini for Biology Bits**",
    "1 Pacific salmon are silvery fish with an amazing life cycle: hatched in rivers and streams of Pacific Rim countries, they migrate to the ocean, where they mature and then return to their rivers. In 2007, these fish generated $1.29 billion in personal income in the United States, according to a report commissioned by the Wild Salmon Center of Portland, Oregon. From fisheries to restaurants, salmon mean money and jobs. In the Pacific Northwest and other areas dependent on salmon, people work hard to ensure the health of salmon populations. They monitor water quality and even remove especially persistent sea lions that stalk salmon runs.",
    "2 Consider another Pacific Northwest fish, the lamprey. Resembling a brown-green eel without a jaw, the lamprey's sucker mouth contains horny teeth and a raspy tongue. Some adult lampreys are parasitic, feeding on other fish and sucking their blood. Like salmon, lampreys are edible, but few people choose to dine on them, finding their appearance and behavior repellent. However, some Native Americans in the Pacific Northwest value and use lampreys. Previously, efforts to protect lamprey populations paled in comparison to efforts to protect salmon. As a result, environmentalists asked that lampreys be protected by the Endangered Species Act.",
    "3 In environmental terms, both types of fish are equally important, but we respond to them differently. This is biobigotry, a prejudice for some animals and against others. In some cases, biobigotry comes from a selfish motive: How does this animal benefit humans? In other cases, the prejudice is born from something as superficial as the way an animal looks or behaves.",
    "4 Consequently, people divide the astounding diversity of the natural world into overly simple categories: good and bad. Carnations are good plants because they smell and look pleasant and bees like them. Dandelions are bad plants because they invade lawns. Nobody would dream of stepping on a ladybug, but good luck to a spider in a human's path. This is ridiculous, of course; no plant or animal is bad. It only seems so because of people's attitudes or overactive imaginations-their biobigotry.",
    "5 Every plant and animal in a habitat is intricately connected, sometimes in unknown ways. Regardless of whether humans value an organism, it may play a crucial role in the survival of other creatures nearby, or we may discover its value in the future. If we are driven by bias in protecting species, we risk eliminating key species upon which other organisms, including ourselves, may depend. We need to move beyond our biobigotry and learn to value all forms of life, in whatever shape or size.",
    "**The Endangered Species Act by Thomas O'Neal, PhD for Habitat News**",
    "6 Plants and animals are essential parts of our world's ecosystem. When a species goes extinct, our ecosystem is forever changed. This is an important consideration because plants and animals are becoming extinct at an extremely high rate. For example, the International Union for Conservation of Nature states that in 2008 approximately 32% of amphibian species were at risk of extinction. No one knows what the impact of even a small percentage of these animals becoming extinct might be.",
    "7 To address this threat, Congress passed the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 1973 to identify and protect the plant and animal species faced with extinction. Currently, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service includes about 2,000 species of flora and fauna on its list. These species and their habitats are protected from being harmed in any way, whether from the capture or hunting of individual animals or from manmade changes to their environment. Enough time has passed to demonstrate that the ESA has been effective. A 2012 study by the Center for Biological Diversity found that 90% of the species protected by the ESA are recovering. By shielding critical species, the act has enabled animals such as the bald eagle, the gray wolf, and the California condor to survive.",
    "8 Unfortunately, the ESA cannot do all the work. Public involvement is essential. A 2012 study by professors Berry Brosi and Eric Biber found that citizen action plays a valuable role in identifying at-risk species and ensuring that those species are protected. Petitions, news releases, and even court actions identify endangered organisms and keep them in the public eye so that receiving aid is more likely.",
    "9 However, in this never-ending battle, there have always been those who think of the natural world primarily in economic terms. These critics argue that there is no point in protecting plant and animal species that have no market value. Too common are attempts to bypass ESA rules for logging, grazing, or building and developing in protected habitats.",
    "10 Plants and animals cannot vote. They cannot advocate for their own value. It is up to people to advocate for them and to make sure the spirit of the ESA is not weakened by those who think they can identify the \"value\" of a plant or an animal with dollar signs."
